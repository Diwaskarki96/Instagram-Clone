# Instagram Clone:

This is a social media web application inspired by Instagram. Itâ€™s designed to provide a platform where users can share their life moments with others. While the project is still under development, it already has several key features implemented:

#User Authentication:

Users can create an account and log in to the application. This provides a personalized experience and ensures that users can securely manage their posts and profile.

#Profile Management:

Users have the ability to edit their profile information. This includes updating their name, bio, and profile picture.

#Posting:

Users can add new posts to share their moments. Each post can include text and an image.

#Feed:

Users can view all posts from their feed. The feed is a collection of posts from the user, providing a central place to view and interact with content.

Future enhancements to the project will include the ability for users to like posts, follow other users, and comment on posts. These features will provide more ways for users to interact with each other and engage with the content they care about.

# Purpose:

The main purpose of this project is to understand the backend development of a web application. This involves learning about server-side programming, databases, user authentication, request handling, and API development. By building an Instagram clone, I have gained practical experience with these concepts and understand how they work together to power a web application. This project serves as a valuable stepping stone towards becoming a proficient developer.
